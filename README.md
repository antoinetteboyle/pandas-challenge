PyCitySchools

![Education analysis of schools](./Images/education.png)

Analysis helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

The main code written in Jupyter Notebook is in the folder called PyCitySchools. A resources folder contains the data.

Two observable trends based on the data:

1.) The District Summary shows that overall students performed better in Reading than Math. 85.80% of students passed Reading compared to just 74.98% passing Math. The Overall Pass % was just 65.17% showing that much less students passed both Reading and Math.

2.) The top 5 performimg schools obtained excelent overall pass results between 90% and 91% and the budget per student was between $578 and $638.

 The worst performing schools obtained poor overall pass results between 52% and 53% and the budget per student was between $637 and $655.

![Bottom 5% of schools](./Images/Bottom5schools.png)

This indicates that a high per student budget does not necessarily result in increased pass results.
